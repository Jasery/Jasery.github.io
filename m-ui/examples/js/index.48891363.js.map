precision\n// needs. Use the setMaxDigits() function to do this. See comments below.\n//\n// Tweaked by Ian Bunning\n// Alterations:\n// Fix bug in function biFromHex(s) to allow\n// parsing of strings of length != 0 (mod 4)\n\n// Changes made by Dave Shapiro as of 12/30/2004:\n//\n// The BigInt() constructor doesn't take a string anymore. If you want to\n// create a BigInt from a string, use biFromDecimal() for base-10\n// representations, biFromHex() for base-16 representations, or\n// biFromString() for base-2-to-36 representations.\n//\n// biFromArray() has been removed. Use biCopy() instead, passing a BigInt\n// instead of an array.\n//\n// The BigInt() constructor now only constructs a zeroed-out array.\n// Alternatively, if you pass <true>, it won't construct any array. See the\n// biCopy() method for an example of this.\n//\n// Be sure to set maxDigits depending on your precision needs. The default\n// zeroed-out array ZERO_ARRAY is constructed inside the setMaxDigits()\n// function. So use this function to set the variable. DON'T JUST SET THE\n// VALUE. USE THE FUNCTION.\n//\n// ZERO_ARRAY exists to hopefully speed up construction of BigInts(). By\n// precalculating the zero array, we can just use slice(0) to make copies of\n// it. Presumably this calls faster native code, as opposed to setting the\n// elements one at a time. I have not done any timing tests to verify this\n// claim.\n\n// Max number = 10^16 - 2 = 9999999999999998;\n//               2^53     = 9007199254740992;\n\nvar biRadixBase = 2;\nvar biRadixBits = 16;\nvar bitsPerDigit = biRadixBits;\nvar biRadix = 1 << 16; // = 2^16 = 65536\nvar biHalfRadix = biRadix >>> 1;\nvar biRadixSquared = biRadix * biRadix;\nvar maxDigitVal = biRadix - 1;\nvar maxInteger = 9999999999999998;\n\n// maxDigits:\n// Change this to accommodate your largest number size.

For long keys,\n* this can result in serious timing delays (e.g. 7-8 seconds to decrypt using\n* 2048 bit keys on a reasonably fast machine, under the Firefox Web browser).\n*\n* If you intend to send encrypted messagess to a JavaScript program running\n* under a Web browser, you might consider using shorter keys to keep the\n* decryption times low.
